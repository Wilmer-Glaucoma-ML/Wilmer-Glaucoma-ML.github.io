          Differences in visual field loss pattern when transitioning from SITA standard to Sita Faster</a>}, 
  abstract={Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm (SITA) Faster is the most recent and fastest testing algorithm for the evaluation of Humphrey visual fields (VF). 
          However, existing evidence suggests that there are some differences in global measures of VF loss in eyes transitioning from SITA Standard to the newer SITA Faster. 
          These differences may be relevant, especially in glaucoma, where VF changes over time influence clinical decisions around treatment. 
          Furthermore, characterization of differences in localizable VF loss patterns between algorithms, rather than global summary measures, can be important for clinician 
          interpretation when transitioning testing strategies. In this study, we determined the effect of transitioning from SITA Standard to SITA Faster on VF loss patterns in 
          glaucomatous eyes undergoing longitudinal VF testing in a real-world clinical setting. Archetypal analysis was used to derive composition weights of 16 clinically relevant VF 
          patterns (i.e., archetypes (AT)) from patient VFs. We found switching from SITA Standard to SITA Faster was associated with less preservation of VF loss 
          (i.e., abnormal AT 2-4, 6-9, 11, 13, 14) relative to successive SITA Standard exams (P value < 0.01) and was associated with relatively greater preservation of AT 1, the normal VF 
          (P value < 0.01). Eyes that transition from SITA Standard to SITA Faster in a real-world clinical setting have an increased likelihood of preserving patterns reflecting a normal VF 
          and lower tendency to preserve patterns reflecting abnormal VF as compared to consecutive SITA Standard exams in the same eye.},

          The evolving role of the relationship between optic nerve structure and function in glaucoma</a>}, 
  abbr={Opth},
  abstract={The relationship between functional vision loss and structural changes of the optic nerve head and retinal ganglion cells is the hallmark of glaucoma diagnosis. 
            Understanding and measuring this relationship has been the focus of numerous studies, the goal of which have been to improve glaucoma diagnosis and detection of 
            glaucoma worsening. In this review, a historical perspective is used to understand structure–function relationships in glaucoma and their application to improve 
            glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. Initially, histologic studies that link visual field sensitivity to retinal ganglion cell count are discussed. 
            Additionally, those studies that determined the mathematical relationship between visual field sensitivity and ganglion cell number are reviewed. 
            Next, those studies that attempt to create a map of the structure–function relationship using fundus photography and visual field sensitivity are examined. 
            Subsequently, studies that use more recent imaging technology, such as optical coherence tomography, confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, or scanning laser perimetry, 
            to measure structure quantitatively in vivo and to correlate these measures with automated perimetry are explored. Among these studies that use advanced imaging, 
            those that use cross-sectional data to explore structure–function relationships to improve glaucoma diagnosis first are discussed. 
            Second, those studies that use longitudinal data to improve detection of worsening are reviewed. Finally, areas of further research and steps needed to implement 
            structure–function relationships clinically are explored.},
