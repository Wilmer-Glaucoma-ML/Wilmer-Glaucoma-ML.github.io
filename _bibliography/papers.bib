	abstract = {Linear regression of optical coherence tomography measurements of peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness is often used to detect glaucoma progression and forecast future disease course. However, current measurement frequencies suggest that clinicians often apply linear regression to a relatively small number of measurements (e.g., less than a handful). In this study, we estimate the accuracy of linear regression in predicting the next reliable measurement of average retinal nerve fiber layer thickness using Zeiss Cirrus optical coherence tomography measurements of average retinal nerve fiber layer thickness from a sample of 6,471 eyes with glaucoma or glaucoma-suspect status. Linear regression is compared to two null models: no glaucoma worsening, and worsening due to aging. Linear regression on the first M ≥ 2 measurements was significantly worse at predicting a reliable M+1st measurement for 2 ≤ M ≤ 6. This range was reduced to 2 ≤ M ≤ 5 when retinal nerve fiber layer thickness measurements were first "corrected" for scan quality. Simulations based on measurement frequencies in our sample-on average 393 ± 190 days between consecutive measurements-show that linear regression outperforms both null models when M ≥ 5 and the goal is to forecast moderate (75th percentile) worsening, and when M ≥ 3 for rapid (90th percentile) worsening. If linear regression is used to assess disease trajectory with a small number of measurements over short time periods (e.g., 1-2 years), as is often the case in clinical practice, the number of optical coherence tomography examinations needs to be increased.},

	abstract = {To develop and evaluate the performance of a deep learning model (DLM) that predicts eyes at high risk of surgical intervention for uncontrolled glaucoma based on multimodal data from an initial ophthalmology visit. Longitudinal, observational, retrospective study. 4898 unique eyes from 4038 adult glaucoma or glaucoma-suspect patients who underwent surgery for uncontrolled glaucoma (trabeculectomy, tube shunt, xen, or diode surgery) between 2013 and 2021, or did not undergo glaucoma surgery but had 3 or more ophthalmology visits. We constructed a DLM to predict the occurrence of glaucoma surgery within various time horizons from a baseline visit. Model inputs included spatially oriented visual field (VF) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) data as well as clinical and demographic features. Separate DLMs with the same architecture were trained to predict the occurrence of surgery within 3 months, within 3-6 months, within 6 months-1 year, within 1-2 years, within 2-3 years, within 3-4 years, and within 4-5 years from the baseline visit. Included eyes were randomly split into 60\%, 20\%, and 20\% for training, validation, and testing. DLM performance was measured using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and precision-recall curve (PRC). Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) were utilized to assess the importance of different features. Model prediction of surgery for uncontrolled glaucoma within 3 months had the best AUC of 0.92 (95\% CI 0.88, 0.96). DLMs achieved clinically useful AUC values ({\textgreater} 0.8) for all models that predicted the occurrence of surgery within 3 years. According to SHAP analysis, all 7 models placed intraocular pressure (IOP) within the five most important features in predicting the occurrence of glaucoma surgery. Mean deviation (MD) and average retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness were listed among the top 5 most important features by 6 of the 7 models. DLMs can successfully identify eyes requiring surgery for uncontrolled glaucoma within specific time horizons. Predictive performance decreases as the time horizon for forecasting surgery increases. Implementing prediction models in a clinical setting may help identify patients that should be referred to a glaucoma specialist for surgical evaluation.},

               field (VF) worsening using deep learning models (DLMs) trained
               on early VF, OCT, and clinical data. DESIGN: Retrospective
               cohort study. SUBJECTS: 4,536 eyes from 2,962 patients. 263
               (5.80\%) of eyes underwent rapid VF worsening (MD slope <-1dB/yr
               across all VFs). METHODS: We included eyes that met the
               following criteria: 1) followed for glaucoma or suspect status
               2) had at least five longitudinal reliable VFs (VF1, VF2, VF3,
               VF4, VF5) 3) had one reliable baseline Optical Coherence
               Tomography (OCT) scan (OCT1) and one set of baseline clinical
               measurements (Clinical1) at the time of VF1. We designed a DLM
               to forecast future rapid VF worsening. The input consisted of
               spatially oriented total deviation values from VF1 (including or
               not including VF2 and VF3 in some models) and retinal nerve
               fiber layer thickness values from the baseline OCT. We passed
               this VF/OCT stack into a vision transformer feature extractor,
               the output of which was concatenated with baseline clinical data
               before putting it through a linear classifier to predict that
               eye's risk of rapid VF worsening across the five VFs. We
               compared the performance of models with differing inputs by
               computing area under receiver operating curve (AUC) in the test
               set. Specifically, we trained models with the following inputs:
               Model V: VF1; VC: VF1+ Clinical1; VO: VF1+ OCT1; VOC: VF1+
               Clinical1+ OCT1; V2: VF1 + VF2; V2OC: VF1 + VF2 + Clinical1 +
               OCT1; V3: VF1 + VF2 + VF3; V3OC: VF1 + VF2 + VF3 + Clinical1 +
               OCT1. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: AUC of DLMs when forecasting
               rapidly worsening eyes. RESULTS: Model V3OC best forecasted
               rapid worsening with an AUC (95\% CI) of 0.87 (0.77, 0.97).
               Remaining models in descending order of performance and their
               respective AUC [95\% CI] were: Model V3 (0.84 [0.74 to 0.95]),
               Model V2OC (0.81 [0.70 to 0.92]), Model V2 (0.81 [0.70 to
               0.82]), Model VOC (0.77 [0.65, 0.88]), Model VO [0.75 [0.64,
               0.88], Model VC (0.75 [0.63, 0.87]), Model V (0.74 [0.62,
               0.86]). CONCLUSION: DLMs can forecast future rapid glaucoma
               worsening with modest to high performance when trained using
               data from early in the disease course. Including baseline data
               from multiple modalities and subsequent visits improves
               performance beyond using VF data alone.",

   abstract={Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness, and its worsening is most often monitored with visual field (VF) testing. Deep learning models
    (DLM) may help identify VF worsening consistently and reproducibly. In this study, we developed and investigated the performance of a DLM on a large population
     of glaucoma patients. We included 5099 patients (8705 eyes) seen at one institute from June 1990 to June 2020 that had VF testing as well as clinician assessment
      of VF worsening. Since there is no gold standard to identify VF worsening, we used a consensus of six commonly used algorithmic methods which include global
       regressions as well as point-wise change in the VFs. We used the consensus decision as a reference standard to train/test the DLM and evaluate clinician performance.
        80%, 10%, and 10% of patients were included in training, validation, and test sets, respectively. Of the 873 eyes in the test set, 309 [60.6%] were from females
         and the median age was 62.4; (IQR 54.8–68.9). The DLM achieved an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI 0.93–0.99). Even after removing the 6 most recent VFs, providing fewer data
          points to the model, the DLM successfully identified worsening with an AUC of 0.78 (95% CI 0.72–0.84). Clinician assessment of worsening (based on documentation
           from the health record at the time of the final VF in each eye) had an AUC of 0.64 (95% CI 0.63–0.66). Both the DLM and clinician performed worse when the initial
            disease was more severe. This data shows that a DLM trained on a consensus of methods to define worsening successfully identified VF worsening and could help guide
             clinicians during routine clinical care.},

          Differences in visual field loss pattern when transitioning from SITA standard to Sita Faster</a>}, 
  abstract={Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm (SITA) Faster is the most recent and fastest testing algorithm for the evaluation of Humphrey visual fields (VF). 
          However, existing evidence suggests that there are some differences in global measures of VF loss in eyes transitioning from SITA Standard to the newer SITA Faster. 
          These differences may be relevant, especially in glaucoma, where VF changes over time influence clinical decisions around treatment. 
          Furthermore, characterization of differences in localizable VF loss patterns between algorithms, rather than global summary measures, can be important for clinician 
          interpretation when transitioning testing strategies. In this study, we determined the effect of transitioning from SITA Standard to SITA Faster on VF loss patterns in 
          glaucomatous eyes undergoing longitudinal VF testing in a real-world clinical setting. Archetypal analysis was used to derive composition weights of 16 clinically relevant VF 
          patterns (i.e., archetypes (AT)) from patient VFs. We found switching from SITA Standard to SITA Faster was associated with less preservation of VF loss 
          (i.e., abnormal AT 2-4, 6-9, 11, 13, 14) relative to successive SITA Standard exams (P value < 0.01) and was associated with relatively greater preservation of AT 1, the normal VF 
          (P value < 0.01). Eyes that transition from SITA Standard to SITA Faster in a real-world clinical setting have an increased likelihood of preserving patterns reflecting a normal VF 
          and lower tendency to preserve patterns reflecting abnormal VF as compared to consecutive SITA Standard exams in the same eye.},

          The evolving role of the relationship between optic nerve structure and function in glaucoma</a>}, 
  abbr={Opth},
  abstract={The relationship between functional vision loss and structural changes of the optic nerve head and retinal ganglion cells is the hallmark of glaucoma diagnosis. 
            Understanding and measuring this relationship has been the focus of numerous studies, the goal of which have been to improve glaucoma diagnosis and detection of 
            glaucoma worsening. In this review, a historical perspective is used to understand structure–function relationships in glaucoma and their application to improve 
            glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. Initially, histologic studies that link visual field sensitivity to retinal ganglion cell count are discussed. 
            Additionally, those studies that determined the mathematical relationship between visual field sensitivity and ganglion cell number are reviewed. 
            Next, those studies that attempt to create a map of the structure–function relationship using fundus photography and visual field sensitivity are examined. 
            Subsequently, studies that use more recent imaging technology, such as optical coherence tomography, confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, or scanning laser perimetry, 
            to measure structure quantitatively in vivo and to correlate these measures with automated perimetry are explored. Among these studies that use advanced imaging, 
            those that use cross-sectional data to explore structure–function relationships to improve glaucoma diagnosis first are discussed. 
            Second, those studies that use longitudinal data to improve detection of worsening are reviewed. Finally, areas of further research and steps needed to implement 
            structure–function relationships clinically are explored.},
