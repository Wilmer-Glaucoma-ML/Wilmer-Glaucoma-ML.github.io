Our lab focuses on developing and assessing machine learning (ML) techniques that strive to reduce the risk of glaucoma-related vision loss. We are an interdisciplinary group of faculty, research associates, and students from the Wilmer Eye Institute and the Malone Center for Engineering in Healthcare at Johns Hopkins.
